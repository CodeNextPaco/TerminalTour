# TerminalTour Challenges
Sample files for use in Code Next's Terminal Tour

### Todo:

1. Create a new directory in your computer, you can call it CodeNext.
2. In that directory clone this repo:
`$ git clone https://github.com/CodeNextPaco/TerminalTour.git`

3. Create 2 new directories: poems and pics.
4. Move the image file to the pic  directory using `mv`
5. Move the poems to the poems directory
6. Add a new text file using ` $ touch mypoem.txt` in the poems directory.
7. Open that file and write a short poem!
8. Print out the contents of your poem and other poems using ` $ cat mypoem.txt`
9. Add more lines to your poem using ` $ echo a new line I just made up! >> mypoem.txt`
10. Find the url to another image online (another Pokemon?) and curl into the pics folder with a short file name.
11. Using nano, write a Python script that prints out "Hello Terminal". Save it and run it.
